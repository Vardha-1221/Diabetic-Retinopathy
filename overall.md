# üåü **Overall Project Importance: From Basics to Innovation**

## üå± **The Human Need: Food, Health, and Diabetes**

### 1. **We Eat Food for Survival**
- **Food provides energy** and nutrients essential for our bodies to function.
- **Modern diets** have evolved to include high amounts of sugar, processed foods, and refined carbohydrates.
- **Sedentary lifestyles** combined with poor dietary choices have created a global health crisis.

### 2. **The Rise of Diabetes**
- **Diabetes mellitus** is a chronic metabolic disorder where the body cannot properly regulate blood sugar levels.
- **Type 2 diabetes** is primarily caused by lifestyle factors: poor diet, lack of exercise, and obesity.
- **Global epidemic**: Over 537 million people worldwide have diabetes, with numbers rising rapidly.

### 3. **The Hidden Danger: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)**
- **Diabetes damages small blood vessels** throughout the body, particularly in the eyes.
- **Diabetic Retinopathy** is a serious complication where high blood sugar damages the retina's blood vessels.
- **Progressive disease**: Starts with mild symptoms and can progress to complete blindness.
- **Silent progression**: Early stages often have no visible symptoms‚Äîby the time vision is affected, damage is often irreversible.

### 4. **The Critical Challenge: Early Detection**
- **Early detection** of DR can prevent 90% of diabetes-related blindness.
- **Traditional screening** requires:
  - Trained ophthalmologists or retinal specialists
  - Expensive retinal cameras and imaging equipment
  - Regular patient visits and follow-ups
- **Accessibility issues**: Many people, especially in rural or low-resource areas, lack access to regular eye exams.
